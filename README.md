##Ploadmon
Here comes a system monitor **for linux hosts** which uses python, flask, uikit and morris.js. *BTW it's one of my PDP goals ;)*

###Features
- Static host info - OS release & kernel, CPU model, total RAM and total HDD space.
- Dynamic host info in real time** - HDD & RAM usage, CPU load.
- No images, only icon fonts & canvas. Zoom forever without loosing quality.
- Responsive design. Ploadmon switches to mobile mode when detects small screens.
- MIT license for everything except morris.js charts, which uses Simplified BSD License.

###Coming soon
- **Top process list**
- **Network load chart**
